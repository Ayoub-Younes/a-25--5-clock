# 25 + 5 Clock

This is a 25 + 5 Clock project created as part of my JavaScript Libraries certification from FreeCodeCamp. The project is a pomodoro-style clock that allows users to set session and break lengths, start/stop the timer, and reset everything.

## Project Overview

The 25 + 5 Clock allows users to adjust session and break durations. The clock displays the current session type (Session or Break) and counts down accordingly. When the timer reaches zero, an alarm sound is played, and the clock switches between session and break times. The layout is responsive, designed using CSS and Flexbox. The project prevents invalid inputs and ensures correct transitions between states.
